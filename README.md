React Landing Page Project #1
This project is a solo project created after enrolling in Scrimba’s free React course.

Description
The free path in Scrimba’s React course doesn’t have solo projects, so I decided to encourage myself to do one. I went to this website “https://www.semrush.com/blog/what-is-a-landing-page/” and tried to replicate the first image using React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
